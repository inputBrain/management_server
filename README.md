# THIS PROJECT I DO JUST FOR FUN.

 Application for management (CRUD) Notes. 

 Here have to be 4 endpoints:
 GET /notes (get all notes)
 GET /note/{id} (get specific note)
 POST /note (create note)
 PUT /note/{id} (update note)
 DELETE /note/{id}  (delete note)

 Also, I will add client controller and admin. For each type of users i will use different way to show some information.
 For example: Admin will able to edit any user's note but user will able to edit only his note(s) and so on.
